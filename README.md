# pixelSpreadSheet

Below are my notes and code for converting an RGB image into a color formatted 2D spreadsheet. Similar to what is done at the following website: https://leondrolio.com/apps/pixel-spreadsheet/ and formally at https://think-maths.co.uk/spreadsheet (link has been removed and was oringally from Matt Parker https://standupmaths.com/)

A PNG of a formatted spreadsheet is returned along with an excel file which contains the RGB images as a 2D spreadsheet with the r,g,b color components interleved into one array. The excel file lacks color formatting but can easily be applied in excel or another spreadsheet application.
